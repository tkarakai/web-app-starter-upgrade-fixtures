/**
 * App configuration: the values an app built on the starter is expected to change.
 *
 * This file is app-owned. Starter code reads these values and never repeats
 * them as literals, so renaming the product, moving a port or changing the
 * auth cookie prefix is an edit here and nowhere else.
 *
 * - Validated when loaded (`platform/packages/app-config/src/schema.ts`): an invalid
 *   value stops dev, build and tests with a message naming the setting.
 * - Everything here is public: it is checked in and bundled into client code.
 *   Per-deployment values (deployed URLs, Convex URLs) and secrets stay
 *   environment variables; see platform/AGENTS.md "Environment variables".
 * - Consumers: import `appConfig` from `@web-app-starter/app-config` in TypeScript; shell
 *   scripts and CI use `platform/tooling/app-config.ts` (see platform/docs/development.md).
