 * The origin this request was served on, e.g. `https://app.example.com`.
 *
 * Used for canonical URLs, the sitemap and robots.txt. Deriving the origin from
 * the request rather than from a SITE_URL variable keeps one more piece of
 * environment identity out of the build — a promoted artifact reports whichever
 * host actually served it, with no configuration to keep in sync.
 *
 * Reading headers opts the caller into dynamic rendering, which is required
 * anyway: a statically prerendered route would bake the origin in at build time.
 *
 * See platform/docs/deployment-architecture.md
