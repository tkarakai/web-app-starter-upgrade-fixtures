# Fail if an environment-specific value was baked into a build artifact.
#
# Build-once/promote requires that an artifact built against one environment's
# config can be deployed to another. That holds only when no environment-specific
# value was inlined at build time. Next.js inlines every NEXT_PUBLIC_* variable
# into the client bundle, and inlines any process.env read that happens during a
# static prerender — so the guarantee cannot be established by reading the source.
# It has to be checked against the output.
#
# Usage:
#   platform/tooling/check-env-leak.sh <app> [--warn]      (from the repository root)
#
#     --warn   report leaks but exit 0 (used while the migration is in progress)
#
# Values are read from the pulled Vercel env file when present, else from the
# ambient environment.

Build is NOT promotable — environment-specific values are baked in.
Each value above must be resolved at request time instead of build time:
  - Server code: read process.env.<VAR> (unprefixed) from a dynamically rendered route.
  - Client code: read it from the public-config provider, which the root layout
    populates at request time.
