# Building on the platform

This file is the platform's usage guide for coding agents and developers. It describes the
platform version installed in this repository and is replaced on every platform upgrade, so it
always matches the installed code. Your app's own guide is the root `AGENTS.md`.

Detail lives in [`platform/docs/`](docs/) and in platform skills. Read a topic guide before
working in its area; they are not loaded automatically.

## Stack

A **Bun workspaces + Turborepo** monorepo:

- **Next.js 16** apps on **React 19** (App Router, Server Components), **TypeScript** strict mode
- **Convex** backend (database, file storage, API functions) in `packages/backend`
- **Better Auth** wired to Convex (`@web-app-starter/auth`)
- **Radix UI + shadcn/ui** primitives and **Tailwind CSS v4** (`@web-app-starter/design-system`)
- **Internationalization** via `@web-app-starter/i18n` and next-intl: 15 languages including RTL

## The platform zone

- **`platform/` is platform-owned.** Anything under a directory named `platform/`, and any file
  named `platform-*` (including `.claude/skills/platform-*` and `.agents/skills/platform-*`), is
  replaced wholesale on upgrade. Don't edit it: your change would be lost. It holds the
  `@web-app-starter/*` packages (`platform/packages/`), the admin dashboard and component
  showcase (`platform/apps/`), dev and CI tooling (`platform/tooling/`), config bases
  (`platform/config/`), docs, skills, templates, and the release files (`CHANGELOG.md`,
  `UPGRADING.md`, `VERSIONING.md`, `VERSION`, licences). In the backend,
  `packages/backend/convex/platform/` holds the platform's Convex functions, tables
  (`platformTables`), HTTP routes and Better Auth component. Audit, settings, announcement, waitlist, invitation and protected-admin storage live in the
  `@web-app-starter/convex-platform` component installed by `convex.config.ts`; its public
  wrappers remain `api.platform.<module>.*`. Use `AuditTrailEvent`, `Announcement`, `WaitlistEntry`,
  `InvitationToken`, `AdminInvitation` and `AdminEmail` from `@repo/backend` for component rows (their IDs are opaque strings), and the shared `convex/test.modules.ts` factory for backend tests.
- **The zone check (`bun run check:zone`, in CI) enforces this.** In an adopted app (`bun run adopt`, once on a fresh clone, writes `.platform-base.json`), every zone
  file that differs from the release commit in `.platform-base.json` must be a recorded patch
  (a `PLATFORM-PATCH: <reason>` comment plus an entry in `patches`); the `platform-patch` skill
  makes one and drafts the request to us. It also fails when a seam loses a platform hook.
- **Seams** are the files where your app meets the platform. Edit them, and keep the platform's
  entries intact:

  | Seam | Use it to |
  |---|---|
  | `app.config.ts` | Set product name, legal entity, support email, local ports, auth cookie prefix, brand and feature switches (`platform-configure`) |
  | `packages/backend/convex/schema.ts` | Add your tables after the `...platformTables` hook (`platform-add-table`) |
  | `packages/backend/convex/http.ts`, `convex.config.ts`, `auth.config.ts` | Add your HTTP routes after `registerPlatformRoutes(http)`, your components after the platform's |
  | `packages/messages/*.json`, `overrides.json` (`@repo/messages`) | Add your strings in your own namespaces, and reword platform strings in `overrides.json` (`platform-add-strings`). Never edit `platform/packages/i18n/messages/` |
  | Root `package.json`, `turbo.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `renovate.json` | Add scripts, tasks, env declarations, lint and dependency rules; `tsconfig` and ESLint extend `platform/config/` |
  | Each app's `.env.example` | Declare the environment variables your code reads |

- **Everything else is yours**, including the reference apps you keep.

Existing deployments upgrading to v2 must complete the [component data migration](docs/component-data-migration.md) before deploying its backend or apps. The deploy guard refuses unmigrated legacy data; fresh empty apps need no copy.

For a published platform update, follow [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md):
`bun run platform:upgrade --to vX.Y.Z --dry-run --report upgrade-report.json`, then
`--resume upgrade-report.json`. Review gates are specific to the plan; the installed baseline
advances only after all required checks pass. Keep pending updates as drafts. For a cloned
workflow draft, use `--resume upgrade-report.json --relocate` before making review edits; see
[update delivery](docs/update-delivery.md) for schedule, credentials and outcomes.

## App configuration

The root `app.config.ts` holds every value an app is expected to change: `identity` (product
name, legal entity, support email), `runtime` (local port per app, Better Auth cookie prefix),
`brand` (icons, design-token overrides, email palette, `lang` and footer) and `features`
(`waitlist`, `invitations`, `announcements`, `environmentBanner`) and `i18n` (`locales`: the
locales the apps ship, a subset of the platform's 15 that includes `en`; optional `defaultLocale`: a shipped locale, default `en`). It is validated on load; a bad
or unknown value stops dev, build and tests with a message naming it. Everything in it is public.

- Never write these values as literals. In TypeScript use `appConfig` (and `localAppOrigin`) from
  `@web-app-starter/app-config`; take cookie names from `@web-app-starter/auth/cookies` (`sessionCookieNames()`,
  `isSessionCookie()`); in shell scripts and CI use `platform/tooling/app-config.ts`
  (`eval "$(./platform/tooling/node-ts.sh platform/tooling/app-config.ts shell)"` gives `APP_CONFIG_*` variables;
  the `setup-bun` action exports them in CI).
- The product name is never in a message file (`packages/messages`, `platform/packages/i18n/messages`): messages that mention it take a
  `{productName}` argument, filled from `appConfig.identity.productName`.
- Per-deployment values (deployed URLs, Convex URLs) and secrets stay environment variables.
- Changing `authCookiePrefix` signs every existing user out.

Details: [docs/development.md](docs/development.md#app-configuration-appconfigts).

```

The default dev launcher, local CI and deployment workflows select exactly one landing app: `apps/landing` when its `package.json` exists, otherwise `apps/landing-static`. Keep at least one installed. There is no deployment opt-in flag. `bun run dev:landing` follows this selection; `bun run dev:landing-static` explicitly starts the static app for development. Both use the managed launcher, logs and stop/status commands. Static-only development needs no Convex backend.

Ports are `runtime.ports` in `app.config.ts`. Development servers and seed accounts: [docs/development.md](docs/development.md).

## Conventions

### Imports

| Package | Import |
|---|---|
| `@web-app-starter/design-system` | `import { Button, cn } from "@web-app-starter/design-system"`; styles: `@web-app-starter/design-system/styles/globals.css` |
| `@web-app-starter/auth` | `@web-app-starter/auth/client` (`authClient`), `@web-app-starter/auth/server` (`auth`, `isAuthenticated`, ...), `@web-app-starter/auth/provider` |
| `@web-app-starter/auth-ui` | Auth pages and their logic. Root: `useAuthUser`, `useSignOut`, `AuthGuard`, `GuestGuard`, `LocaleSwitcher`, `ConvexErrorToast`, the auth forms; `/views`: default pages and layouts (`SignInView`, `ProtectedLayout`, ...); `/proxy`: `authRedirect`; `/routes/auth`, `/routes/clear-session`: route handlers. Web's auth route files re-export these ([docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)) |
| `@repo/backend` | `import { api } from "@repo/backend"`: platform functions are `api.platform.<module>`, app functions `api.<module>` |
| `@web-app-starter/i18n` | Locale config and navigation; translations via `next-intl` (`useTranslations`, `getTranslations`) |
| `@web-app-starter/edge-rate-limit` | Edge rate limiting in `proxy.ts` |

For account security, compose `SecuritySection` (or `ChangePasswordForm`, `TwoFactorSection`,
`PasskeySection` and `SessionsList`) from `@web-app-starter/auth-ui` under the protected layout.
These components own the auth operations and localized feedback; your app owns the page around them.

Within an app, `@/` is an alias for its `src/`. It is app-internal only; across packages import
by package name (`@web-app-starter/*` for the platform, `@repo/backend` for the backend).

### File naming

| Type | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Component | kebab-case.tsx | `user-avatar.tsx` |
| Page | `page.tsx` in a kebab-case folder | `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` |
| Utility | camelCase.ts | `formatDate.ts` or `format.ts` |
| Test | same name + `.test.ts(x)` | `format.test.ts`, `button.test.tsx` |
| E2E test | descriptive `.spec.ts` | `auth-flow.spec.ts` |
| Convex module | camelCase.ts | `launchItems.ts` |

### Code

- Strict TypeScript: explicit types, no `any`, `const`/`let` only (never `var`).
- Server Components by default; a Client Component starts with `"use client"`. Server
  Components cannot use hooks or browser APIs; Convex functions run on the server and have no
  browser APIs either.
- User-visible text in web, landing and landing-static comes from locale messages, including
  errors, placeholders, accessible labels and metadata. Admin is English-only.
- No `console.log` debugging left behind; handle errors explicitly.

## Rules

**Do not:**

- Run bare `bun test`. It picks up Vitest DOM tests and fails; use `bun run test`.
- Edit `packages/backend/convex/_generated/`; Convex generates it.
- Use `npm` or `yarn`; Bun is the package manager.
- Add Python or other scripting languages. Scripts are TypeScript run on Node through
  `platform/tooling/node-ts.sh` (Node 22.6+); shell wrappers are fine.
- Use `turbo dev`; `bun run dev` manages ports, Convex and `.env.local`.
- Test Server Components with Vitest; use Playwright E2E.
- Commit `.env.local`; `.env.example` is the template.
- Rewrite published history: no reset, rebase, force-push or moved refs on shared branches.
- Edit anything under `platform/`.

**Be careful:**

- `convexTest()` in this monorepo needs the module glob: `convexTest(schema, import.meta.glob("./**/*.*s"))` in a test at the `convex/` root; in a subdirectory import `modules` from `convex/test.modules.ts`.
- A protected web page must live under `src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/dashboard/` to get the proxy,
  layout and client guards ([docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)).
- Schema changes that remove, rename or narrow need a widen/migrate/narrow sequence
  ([docs/convex-migrations.md](docs/convex-migrations.md)).

## Environment variables

`web` and `admin` read their configuration **unprefixed, at request time**, so one build can be
promoted between environments. A `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` read would be inlined at build time and pin the
artifact to one environment.

| Variable | Description | Apps |
|---|---|---|
| `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` | Convex deployment identifier | all |
| `CONVEX_URL` | Convex API URL | web, admin |
| `CONVEX_SITE_URL` | Convex HTTP actions URL | web, admin |
| `LANDING_URL` | Marketing site URL, for cross-app links | web |

`landing` and `landing-static` are static exports (`output: "export"`) with no server, so they
**must** inline their configuration at build time:

| Variable | Description | Apps |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | This app's public URL | landing, landing-static |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_APP_URL` | Web app URL, for cross-app links | landing, landing-static |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL` | Convex HTTP actions URL | landing |

Build-identity variables keep the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix everywhere, because they describe the
build: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GIT_SHA`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_GIT_BRANCH`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOY_TIMESTAMP`,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME`. The dev environment banner lists every
`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variable present, including legacy names still set on Vercel projects; web and
admin don't read those.

`SITE_URL` belongs to Convex: a comma-separated list of trusted origins, set with
`convex env set`. `web` and `admin` derive their own origin from the request `Host` header.

**Adding a runtime variable** takes three places: the app's `.env.example`, the hosting project,
and `turbo.json`: `passThroughEnv` if read at request time (web, admin), `env` if inlined at build
time (landing, landing-static). A runtime variable in `env` makes the build hash
environment-specific and silently breaks artifact reuse
([docs/deployment-architecture.md](docs/deployment-architecture.md#artifacts-are-content-addressed)).
`bun run dev` manages `.env.local` for local development.

## Skills

Platform skills live in [`agent-skills/`](agent-skills/) and are linked into `.claude/skills/` and
`.agents/skills/`, so Claude Code and Codex list them. Use the matching skill when a task fits:

| Skill | Use it to |
|---|---|
| `platform-configure` | Set name, ports, cookie prefix, brand and feature switches in `app.config.ts` |
| `platform-add-table` | Add an app table: schema, indexes, functions, tests |
| `platform-add-page` | Add a protected page with a nav entry, strings and tests |
| `platform-add-strings` | Add translated strings in an app namespace to every locale |
| `platform-deps` | Update the app's dependencies (Renovate queue, majors, lockfile) |
| `platform-patch` | Change platform code you can't wait for: mark and record the patch, draft the request |
| `platform-upgrade` | Take a platform release or finish a draft update PR, resolve its report and verify the app |
| `platform-pr-review` | Review a pull request and comment |
| `platform-pr-respond` | Address review comments on a pull request |

## Verification

Before pushing, run `bun run ci` (or `bun run ci:quick` to skip E2E). Keep `lint`, `typecheck` and
the test suites green.
