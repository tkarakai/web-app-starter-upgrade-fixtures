## Route Protection (Authentication)

The auth routes, their logic and their default views are platform code in
`@web-app-starter/auth-ui` (`platform/packages/auth-ui`). The web app's route files only
re-export them, so an app gets fixes on upgrade and can still replace any single page with its
own component:

| Route file (`apps/web/src/app/`) | Re-exports from `@web-app-starter/auth-ui` |
|---|---|
| `[locale]/(auth)/layout.tsx` | `AuthLayout` (`/views`): `GuestGuard` + system theme |
| `[locale]/(auth)/sign-in`, `sign-up`, `forgot-password`, `reset-password` pages | `SignInView`, `SignUpView`, `ForgotPasswordView`, `ResetPasswordView` (`/views`) |
| `[locale]/(verify-email)/verify-email/page.tsx` | `VerifyEmailView` (`/views`) |
| `[locale]/(invitation)/layout.tsx`, `signup-with-invitation/page.tsx` | `PublicAuthLayout`, `InvitationSignupView` (`/views`) |
| `[locale]/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` | `ProtectedLayout` (`/views`) |
| `[locale]/forbidden/page.tsx` | `ForbiddenView` (`/views`) |
| `api/auth/[...all]/route.ts` | `GET`, `POST` (`/routes/auth`) |
| `api/auth/clear-session/route.ts` | `GET` (`/routes/clear-session`) |

To customise a page, replace its re-export with your own component and build it from the
package's parts: `AuthPageShell` (`/views`), and `AuthForm`, `ForgotPasswordForm`,
`ResetPasswordForm`, `VerifyEmailForm`, `InvitationSignupForm` (root export).

The web app uses a **three-layer** auth system. New protected pages get all three layers by
placing them under `apps/web/src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/dashboard/`.

Account security UI is also platform code. Import `SecuritySection` from
`@web-app-starter/auth-ui` for the full password/2FA/passkey/session panel, or compose
`ChangePasswordForm`, `TwoFactorSection`, `PasskeySection` and `SessionsList` separately.
Keep the panel under the protected layout and the app's locale/Convex providers. The web
account page owns its surrounding navigation, profile preferences and page layout; its
`components/settings/` security files are compatibility re-exports. Replacing one with an
app component means maintaining that customization yourself.
Security messages use the platform `accountSecurity` namespace. Customize individual strings
through `packages/messages/overrides.json`; the v2 security-message codemod preserves prior
customized wording from the app's `dashboard` namespace.

| Layer | Where | What it does | Speed |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Proxy** | `apps/web/src/proxy.ts` calling `authRedirect()` (`@web-app-starter/auth-ui/proxy`) | Cookie-presence check (Edge); the app's proxy adds rate limiting, CSP and locale handling | ~1ms |
| **Layout** | `ProtectedLayout` | Full session validation + user preload (RSC), admin/banned/MFA rules | ~50ms |
| **AuthGuard** | `AuthGuard` | Client-side session watcher + redirect | Ongoing |

**To add a new protected page:** create it under `src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/dashboard/`, so its URL
starts with `/dashboard` (the proxy's protected prefix) and it shares the layout's checks. The
`platform-add-page` skill walks through it, including the nav entry and strings.

```
src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/
  layout.tsx                   <- re-exports ProtectedLayout (shared by all pages)
  dashboard/page.tsx           <- existing page
  dashboard/settings/page.tsx  <- existing page
  dashboard/reports/page.tsx   <- new page, protected by all three layers
```

**To access the current user** in any client component under `(dashboard)/`:

```typescript
import { useAuthUser } from "@web-app-starter/auth-ui";

export function MyComponent() {
  const user = useAuthUser(); // { name?, email? } | null
  return <span>{user?.name ?? "Anonymous"}</span>;
}
```

**To sign out**, call the handler from `useSignOut(redirectTo)` (`@web-app-starter/auth-ui`).

**How the layers work together:**

1. **Proxy** (Edge, instant): `authRedirect()` checks for the session cookie (`<prefix>.session_token`, prefix from `runtime.authCookiePrefix` in `app.config.ts`; names from `@web-app-starter/auth/cookies`). No cookie -> redirect to `/sign-in` (keeping the locale, preferring the `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie). Also redirects authenticated users away from the guest-only auth pages to `/dashboard`, unless `?session_cleared` is set.
2. **Layout** (Server Component): `ProtectedLayout` calls `isAuthenticated()` for full session validation, then `preloadAuthQuery(api.platform.auth.getCurrentUser)` to SSR the user data. Stale sessions go to `/api/auth/clear-session`, which clears the cookies and redirects to sign-in.
3. **AuthGuard** (Client Component): Subscribes to the Convex user query for real-time updates and watches the Better Auth session. If the session is invalidated while the page is open, redirects immediately.

**Backend safety:** The `getCurrentUser` Convex query returns `null` (not throws) when unauthenticated, so client-side subscriptions degrade gracefully instead of crashing.

**To protect a route outside `/dashboard` at the proxy:** add its prefix to `protectedPrefixes` in the `authRedirect()` call in `src/proxy.ts`. Guest-only pages are `authRoutes` (`WEB_AUTH_ROUTES` by default).

**Admin** uses the same `authRedirect()`, route handlers, `GuestGuard` broadcast, `ForceSystemTheme` and `useSignOut`; its sign-in and onboarding forms stay admin-specific.

## Guest Pages (Auth Pages)

Guest-only auth pages are wrapped by `GuestGuard` via `AuthLayout`. When a user logs in on another tab:

1. **BroadcastChannel** (instant): The auth form calls `broadcastAuth()` on success. Other tabs' `GuestGuard` receives the message and redirects to `/dashboard`.
2. **Visibility fallback**: When the tab becomes visible, `GuestGuard` calls `authClient.getSession()` to check for an active session and redirects if found.

**To broadcast auth from a new login flow:** call `broadcastAuth()` from `@web-app-starter/auth-ui` after successful authentication.

## Rate Limiting

The application uses three layers of rate limiting. See [rate-limiting-architecture.md](rate-limiting-architecture.md) for limits, settings and local testing.

| Layer | Scope | Storage | Config |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Better Auth** | Auth endpoints (sign-in, sign-up) | Convex DB (betterAuth component `rateLimit` table) | `packages/backend/convex/platform/auth.ts` — env vars via `convex env set` |
| **Convex Functions** | All `authedMutation` calls | Convex DB (`rateLimits` table) | `packages/backend/convex/platform/rateLimits.ts` — env vars via `convex env set` |
| **Edge Proxy** | HTTP page requests (web, admin) | In-memory `Map` (per-instance, capped) | `apps/web/src/proxy.ts`, `platform/apps/admin/src/proxy.ts` — use the shared `@web-app-starter/edge-rate-limit` package |

**Key files:**
- `packages/backend/convex/platform/rateLimits.ts` — Convex rate limit definitions
- `packages/backend/convex/platform/functions.ts` — Global mutation rate limit in `authedMutation`
- `platform/packages/edge-rate-limit/` — Shared edge rate limiter (used by the web and admin proxies)
- `platform/packages/auth-ui/src/components/auth-form.tsx` — Client-side 429 error handling

> **Note**: `landing-static` is a fully static export and does not use edge rate limiting. Rate limiting for static deployments should be handled at the CDN/hosting layer.

**What happens when rate limited:**
- **Auth endpoints**: HTTP 429, auth form shows "Too many attempts. Please wait a moment before trying again."
- **Convex mutations**: `ConvexError` with `{ kind: "RateLimited" }`, `useQuery` subscriptions unaffected
- **Edge proxy**: HTTP 429 with `Retry-After` header, plain "Too Many Requests" page

**Queries are NOT rate limited** — they are read-only and used by `useQuery` real-time subscriptions.

## Client vs Server Components

```typescript
// Server Component (default) - no directive needed
// Can use: async/await, direct database access, server-only code
export default async function ServerPage() {
  const data = await fetchData();
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}

// Client Component - requires directive
"use client";
// Can use: useState, useEffect, event handlers, browser APIs
export function ClientComponent() {
  const [state, setState] = useState(false);
  return <button onClick={() => setState(true)}>Click</button>;
}
```

## Convex React Hooks

```typescript
"use client";

import { useMutation, useQuery } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "@repo/backend";

export function MyComponent() {
  // Queries subscribe to real-time updates
  const items = useQuery(api.launchItems.list);

  // Mutations for creating/updating/deleting
  const createItem = useMutation(api.launchItems.create);

  const handleCreate = async () => {
    await createItem({ title: "New Item" });
  };

  if (items === undefined) return <Loading />;
  return <ItemList items={items} onCreate={handleCreate} />;
}
```

## Platform data component

`@web-app-starter/convex-platform` owns audit events, app settings and announcements. The
app installs it with `app.use(platform)` in `packages/backend/convex/convex.config.ts`. Keep
that hook. App code calls the existing `api.platform.auditTrail`, `api.platform.appSettings`
and `api.platform.announcements` wrappers; those wrappers check identity, permissions and
rate limits. Direct `ctx.db` access from app code cannot reach component data.

Announcement scheduling, cancellation, tie-breaking and audit writes run inside the
component. The wrapper renders announcement URL variables from the app environment and
combines stored email templates with the app-branded defaults. The component needs no new
environment variables. Client announcement IDs are strings; use the exported `Announcement`
type from `@repo/backend` for row data. Never cast them to the app data model’s IDs.

For backend tests, use the shared factory in `convex/test.modules.ts`; see [testing](testing.md).
The legacy app tables remain during the data-migration transition, but new writes and reads
use the component. Historical rows must be migrated before the old schema is removed.

### Waitlists and invitations

Waitlist entries, invitation tokens and admin invitations live in the platform component.
Use the existing `api.platform.waitlist.*`, `api.platform.waitlistTokens.*` and
`api.platform.adminInvitations.*` wrappers. Their component IDs are opaque strings;
row types are exported as `WaitlistEntry`, `InvitationToken` and `AdminInvitation`
from `@repo/backend`. Do not query these tables through the app database.

Wrappers resolve Better Auth sessions, enforce roles and rate limits, and schedule the
app's email transport. The component owns token hashes, claim/revoke transitions and
onboarding state. An admin invitation grants the admin-email entry only after a valid
token is claimed. Bootstrap, local seeds and E2E fixtures use the same component storage.

For paginated waitlist and admin-invitation queries, import `usePaginatedQuery` from
`convex-helpers/react`. Loaded pages are not reactive, and cursors contain index values
(they are not secrets). Reload the list after mutations when fresh rows are needed. A full
page reports `isDone: false`; fetch the next page even when the previous one looked final.
Waitlist pagination excludes admin addresses before selecting a page, so hidden admins do
not shorten visible pages or cause entries to be skipped.

### Protected admin addresses

`adminEmails` is stored in the platform component. The admin-only
`api.platform.adminEmails.listProtected` wrapper returns addresses; backend auth hooks
use `internal.platform.adminEmails.list`. Its rows have the exported `AdminEmail` type.
Signup promotion, protected-admin changes and password-reset policy lookup read this API,
so they use the same state as invitation claims and bootstrap. Component functions are
trusted backend entry points and cannot be called directly by clients.

`userProfiles`, Better Auth sessions and rate-limit state stay in `convex/platform/`
and the host database/components. They do not read the platform component database
directly; settings and protected-address queries cross its typed API boundary.
