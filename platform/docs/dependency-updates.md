# Dependency Updates (Renovate)

Dependency bumps in this monorepo are automated with [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/).
Renovate proposes updates, regenerates `bun.lock`, lets the existing CI pipeline run, and opens
PRs — but **only for releases that are at least 10 days old**, so we adopt versions that the wider
ecosystem has already vetted (not yanked, not a fresh supply-chain surprise).

- Config: the platform preset [`platform/config/renovate-preset.json`](../config/renovate-preset.json), extended by the root [`renovate.json`](../../renovate.json) (see "Preset and the platform zone")
- Workflow: [`.github/workflows/renovate.yml`](../../.github/workflows/renovate.yml)
- Compatibility holds: `HOLD:` rules in the preset (see "Holds" below)
- Every major decision, and what awaits a vendor-side change: its `deps:*` ticket and the PR that
  lands it

## "Self-hosted" — what that means (and doesn't)

Renovate can run two ways: via Mend's cloud-hosted GitHub App, or **"self-hosted"**, which in
Renovate jargon just means *we run the bot ourselves*. Here, "ourselves" is a plain GitHub Actions
workflow on **GitHub-hosted runners**. **Nothing runs outside GitHub**, and this has nothing to do
with "self-hosted runners." We chose this over the Mend app so no third party gets write access to
the repo and we control exactly when it runs; the price is owning the `RENOVATE_TOKEN` secret
(below).

## How it runs

| | |
|---|---|
| **Schedule** | GitHub Actions cron in `renovate.yml` — Monday & Thursday at 06:00 UTC, as a safety net; dependency work is drained with the [`platform-deps` skill](#draining-the-queue). Runs on GitHub's scheduler, which can delay runs 15–60 min under load. |
| **Manual run** | GitHub → **Actions → Renovate → Run workflow** (`workflow_dispatch`). Pick `debug` log level to troubleshoot. |
| **Cooldown** | `minimumReleaseAge: "10 days"` + `internalChecksFilter: "strict"` — a new release is held until it has been public for 10 days. Younger releases show as *pending* on the dashboard rather than as open PRs. |
| **Security fixes** | The cooldown is **shortened to 12 hours for known-vulnerable dependencies**: `vulnerabilityAlerts` (GitHub security alerts) and `osvVulnerabilityAlerts` (OSV database) open fix PRs labeled `security` once the fixed release is 12 hours old. A fix exploited in the wild that our code reaches can be adopted sooner, by the user only. |
| **Progress** | Renovate maintains a **"Dependency Dashboard"** issue listing pending, open, and held updates. Start there. |
| **Lockfile** | Renovate updates `bun.lock` itself (the image bundles Bun and reads `packageManager: bun@…` from the root `package.json`). It also updates the root `overrides` pins. |

> **GitHub quirk:** on public repos, GitHub **disables scheduled workflows after 60 days without
> repo activity**. You get an email first; re-enabling is one click under Actions → Renovate. If
> bump PRs stop appearing on a dormant repo, check this before suspecting the token.

## Preset and the platform zone

The policy below lives in the platform preset, `platform/config/renovate-preset.json`, which is
replaced on every platform upgrade. The root `renovate.json` is a seam: it extends the preset
(`local>owner/repo//platform/config/renovate-preset`, naming this repository) and adds the app's
own rules.

- **The preset never touches the platform zone.** Its `ignorePaths` adds `platform/**`,
  `.github/workflows/platform-*.yml` and `.github/actions/**` to Renovate's defaults. Platform
  dependency upgrades arrive with platform releases; patch-level fixes inside the ranges platform
  manifests declare reach the lockfile through lockfile maintenance.
- **Platform manifests declare ranges (floors), not pins**, so an app can raise a shared
  dependency such as React without editing `platform/`.
- **The product repo is the exception.** The platform is developed there, so its root
  `renovate.json` overrides `ignorePaths` back to the defaults and raises platform floors
  (`rangeStrategy: "bump"` for `platform/**`). An adopted app drops both.

Check that an app configuration leaves the zone alone with a local lookup-only dry run of the
preset (copy it over `renovate.json` first, then restore): no `packageFile` under `platform/` may
appear in `LOG_LEVEL=debug LOG_FORMAT=json npx renovate --platform=local --dry-run=lookup`.

## Update & merge policy

Defined in the preset's `packageRules`:

- **Patch / minor / pin / digest** → **auto-merged** (squash, matching the linear-history rule on
  `main`) once all required CI checks pass (`platformAutomerge`).
- **All non-major updates** → grouped into a single "all non-major dependencies" PR per cycle, so
  automerge PRs do not compete for the "branch must be up to date" requirement on `main` (each merge
  would otherwise leave every other open PR behind until the next run). The auth stack is the one
  exception: it keeps its own never-automerged group.
- **Major versions** → **never auto-merged**, and **no PR opens until approved** on the dashboard
  (`dependencyDashboardApproval`; they wait under *Pending Approval*). While [draining the queue](#draining-the-queue),
  the agent assesses each one with the `platform-deps` skill's major-ticket procedure:
  it reads every release note, adds user-visible behaviour tests first, trials the upgrade, and
  adopts or rejects it. It merges dev tooling and runtime libraries itself. Majors of the
  sensitive frameworks (`next`, `react`/`react-dom`, `convex`, `better-auth` +
  `@convex-dev/better-auth` + `@better-auth/passkey`, `tailwindcss` + `@tailwindcss/postcss`),
  the runtime baseline, and any security-relevant behaviour change need the user's yes. Every major gets a
  ticket (a `dependencies` issue with a `deps:*` status label), worked by one major-ticket run;
  independent tickets run in parallel, merged one at a time. Each decision is recorded on the
  ticket and in the PR description. `convex` and `convex-test` majors travel together in the "convex monorepo" group.
- **Holds** → a major that cannot work yet (an upstream peer range, our runtime floor) is capped
  with `allowedVersions` in a rule whose `description` starts with `HOLD:` and states the
  evidence and the **REMOVE when** condition. Holds are decisions: add or remove them in a
  reviewed PR, never by closing a bot PR silently. Held versions do not appear on the dashboard,
  so each `platform-deps` run re-checks the REMOVE conditions.
- **Lockfile maintenance** → **off in Renovate**, because it pulls transitive deps to their latest
  versions and **sidesteps the 10-day cooldown**. Instead, `platform-deps` regenerates `bun.lock`
  weekly with `bun install --minimum-release-age=864000`, so transitive deps respect the same age,
  and merges it when CI is green.
- **GitHub Actions** → Renovate pins all `uses:` references to **commit SHAs**
  (`helpers:pinGitHubActionDigests`) and keeps the pins updated. Tags like `@v4` are mutable and a
  compromised action repo could repoint them; digests can't be swapped.

> The first run is intentionally noisy — it clears an accumulated drift backlog (several apps trail
> on next/react/convex/tailwind), and one PR will digest-pin every workflow. Expect a wave of PRs,
> after which it stays quiet.

## Draining the queue

Renovate and coding agents both merge to `main`, and `main` requires PRs to be up to date, so
every merge from one side leaves the other side's PRs behind. Drain the dependency queue in one
supervised run with the `platform-deps` skill (`platform/agent-skills/platform-deps/`, usable by any
agent; `/platform-deps` in Claude Code). It always starts with a read-only plan and your decisions,
and acts only after you give the green light. Feature merges are not paused: a merge during the
run only leaves Renovate PRs behind, and the skill re-requests their rebase. It dispatches Renovate, gets each
automerge PR rebased and merged in sequence, triages red PRs, re-checks holds, assesses majors with
its major-ticket procedure, refreshes the lockfile, and stops for a human only where those rules say so.
The Monday/Thursday cron stays as a safety net that keeps the dashboard current. `bun run renovate:status` prints the whole queue state (last run result, open
Renovate PRs, dashboard sections, hold facts) as JSON. Security PRs (`security` label) are not deferred to a `platform-deps` run.

### Handling each PR state

| State | Action |
|---|---|
| Green, automerge armed, **behind** `main` | Tick the PR's *rebase/retry* checkbox, then dispatch Renovate. **Never** use GitHub's *Update branch*: its merge commit counts as a human edit and Renovate stops managing the branch. |
| Green, armed, up to date | GitHub merges it; nothing to do. |
| Conflicting (`DIRTY`) | Renovate rebases its own branches on the next run. |
| Red, flaky | Re-run the failed jobs. |
| Red, needs code changes | Migrate per [`dependency-migrations.md`](dependency-migrations.md) on a `deps/<name>` branch, then close the bot PR with a link. Do not push to `renovate/*`. |
| Red, cannot work yet | Add a `HOLD:` rule with the evidence; Renovate autocloses the PR on its next run. |
| *PR Edited (Blocked)* on the dashboard | Human commits exist; do not tick its checkbox (it discards them). Close or finish the PR by hand. |

## Security model

What automating bumps actually risks, and what defends against it:

- **Malicious release of a legit package** (compromised maintainer): the **10-day cooldown** is the
  main defense — nearly all npm supply-chain attacks are detected and yanked within days, so the
  ecosystem is our canary. Majors additionally always get human review.
- **Install scripts**: this repo has **no `trustedDependencies`** in any `package.json`, so Bun runs
  **no dependency lifecycle scripts** (beyond Bun's small built-in allowlist) — in CI *or* inside
  the Renovate container. Preserve this: adding a package to `trustedDependencies` is a
  security-relevant change and deserves review.
- **Blast radius**: an auto-merged bump lands on `main`, which triggers `cd-staging.yml` → an
  **unattended staging deploy**. This is a deliberate trade — staging exists to absorb exactly this,
  and production deploys stay manual.
- **The token is the crown jewel**: the only actor that can arm auto-merge programmatically is
  whoever holds `RENOVATE_TOKEN`. Keep it a fine-grained PAT scoped to this single repo.

### About "Allow auto-merge"

The repo setting is **repo-wide and cannot be scoped** to Renovate — but it is inert on its own.
It only *permits* arming auto-merge on a PR; a human (or Renovate via its token) must explicitly
enable it **per PR**, and GitHub still merges only after every required check passes and the branch
is up to date. Feature PRs are unaffected unless someone deliberately clicks "Enable auto-merge" on
them.

## The `RENOVATE_TOKEN` secret

**This is the one piece of manual setup, and the system does not work without it.**

### Why it's needed

Renovate authenticates to GitHub with this token. It **must not** be the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`,
because PRs opened by `GITHUB_TOKEN` **do not trigger other workflows** (a GitHub anti-recursion
rule). If Renovate used the default token, our `ci-*.yml` `pull_request` workflows would never run on
bump PRs — so "the tests run" would silently be false, and auto-merge (which waits on those checks)
could never complete.

### Creating it (fine-grained PAT)

1. GitHub → **Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens → Generate new token**.
2. **Resource owner:** the org/user that owns this repo. **Repository access:** *Only select repositories* → this repo.
3. **Repository permissions:**
   - Contents: **Read and write**
   - Pull requests: **Read and write**
   - Workflows: **Read and write**
   - Issues: **Read and write** (for the Dependency Dashboard)
   - Commit statuses: **Read and write** (for the `renovate/stability-days` hold)
   - Dependabot alerts: **Read-only** (for the security-fix fast path / `vulnerabilityAlerts`)

   > **Commit statuses is not optional, and omitting it fails quietly.** Renovate publishes
   > the `minimumReleaseAge` hold as a commit status. Without the permission,
   > `POST /repos/:owner/:repo/statuses/:sha` returns `403 Resource not accessible by
   > personal access token`; Renovate turns that into a `repository-changed` result and
   > **aborts the repository run while the workflow step still exits 0**. The 2026-09-16
   > verification dispatch got through 4 of 34 branches before stopping, never pushed
   > `renovate/auth-stack`, and never created the Dependency Dashboard — on a green run.
   > The only expected 403 is `GET /user/emails`, which fine-grained PATs cannot read.
4. **Expiration:** set a finite expiry (e.g. 90 days) and note the date — see *Rotation* below.
5. Generate and copy the token.

> **Team alternative:** for shared ownership, create a dedicated **GitHub App** instead of a PAT
> (no personal account tied to it, finer control, longer-lived) and pass its installation token to
> the action. A PAT is fine to start.

### Storing it

GitHub → repo **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**:

- **Name:** `RENOVATE_TOKEN`
- **Value:** the token from above

`renovate.yml` reads it via `token: ${{ secrets.RENOVATE_TOKEN }}`.

> Note: any repo Actions secret is readable by anyone who can push workflow changes to the repo.
> On a single-owner repo that collapses to the owner; on a team repo, prefer the GitHub App route
> and environment-scoped secrets.

### Managing & rotating it

- **Owner:** record who owns the token (a person, or the GitHub App).
- **Expiry:** fine-grained PATs expire. Put the renewal date somewhere visible.
- **Rotate:** regenerate the token (or extend its expiry) → update the `RENOVATE_TOKEN` secret with
  the new value. No code change needed.
- **Symptoms of an expired/invalid token:** the **Renovate** Actions run fails at authentication, or
  more subtly, Renovate stops opening PRs and the Dependency Dashboard goes stale. If bump PRs stop
  appearing, check the token first (then the 60-day schedule pause, above).

## Repo settings required for auto-merge

Auto-merge only works when GitHub permits it **and** CI checks are *required* — otherwise Renovate's
`platformAutomerge` merges as soon as GitHub allows, **before** CI finishes.

Configure these on your repository (via `gh api` or Settings):

1. **Settings → General → Pull Requests → "Allow auto-merge"** — enabled.
2. **Merge-commit method disabled** — the `main` ruleset requires linear history, so merge commits
   could never merge anyway; squash/rebase only. `renovate.json` sets
   `automergeStrategy: "squash"` to match.
3. **Required status checks on `main`** — the `*-complete` summary jobs from `ci-shared`, `ci-web`,
   `ci-admin`, `ci-landing`, `ci-landing-static` and `ci-storybook`, with "require branches to be
   up to date". If you use both classic branch protection and a ruleset, they are independent
   copies: a change to one is not a change to the other, so update and verify both:

   ```bash
   gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/branches/main/protection \
     --jq '.required_status_checks.contexts'
   gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/rulesets/<ruleset-id> \
     --jq '.rules[] | select(.type=="required_status_checks")
           | .parameters.required_status_checks[].context'
   ```

   The ruleset is updated with `PUT`, which **replaces the whole ruleset**: read it first and send
   back every rule plus `bypass_actors`, or you will silently drop protections. Re-check
   `[.rules[].type]` afterwards.
4. The **`RENOVATE_TOKEN`** secret exists (above).

## Diagnosing a stalled queue

The dashboard is persistent: retain it after catch-up. Its **Open** section is a snapshot of
Renovate's last run, not a live PR query. Check current PR heads, checks, merge conflicts and
`auto_merge` state on GitHub; an eligible non-major PR can still have automerge manually disabled.
Strict branch protection also requires current-base validation, not just an older green head.
The five-PR concurrent limit holds further updates until slots open; **Pending Status Checks**
usually includes the release-age hold. Do not bypass both controls by selecting every checkbox.
**PR Edited (Blocked)** means Renovate detected human commits and stopped updating the branch.
Do not select its restart checkbox: it discards those commits. Repair additively on an isolated
branch (or use a replacement with explicit provenance), preserving the original history.

A successful workflow alone is not proof Renovate completed: inspect the repository result in
its logs. In particular, the Bun-manager warning **"Could not re-extract the packageFile after
updating it"** can occur *after* successful lockfile generation. It means the post-artifact
release-age check could not re-extract the resolved dependency, not that `package.json` is
necessarily malformed. The upstream investigation is
[renovatebot/renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/pull/45278) (closed without merging).
Do not silence this warning by disabling the cooldown or assume a frozen install proves release
age: inspect the generated lockfile and registry publication dates for affected updates, and
track the upstream limitation until a released fix is verified. For a manual repair, regenerate
from the preserved pre-update lockfile with `bun install --minimum-release-age=864000` (10 days),
then run `bun install --frozen-lockfile` and inspect publication dates of newly resolved versions.
The age flag does not retroactively reject young versions already recorded in a lockfile.
This is separate from the weekly lockfile refresh by `platform-deps`, which applies the same age
filter to transitive dependencies.

## Validating a config change

Before merging edits to `renovate.json` or the preset:

```bash
npx --yes --package renovate renovate-config-validator renovate.json platform/config/renovate-preset.json
```

For a local dry run (no PRs created), from the repo root:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug npx renovate --platform=local
```

Confirm it proposes bumps, **withholds** releases younger than 10 days ("Not enough time has
elapsed"), and plans to update `bun.lock` and the root `overrides`.
