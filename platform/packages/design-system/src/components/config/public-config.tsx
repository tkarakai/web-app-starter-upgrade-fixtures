 * Environment-specific values that client components need at runtime.
 *
 * These deliberately do NOT use `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`. Next.js inlines every
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variable into the client bundle at build time, which pins the
 * build to one environment and makes it impossible to promote a staging
 * artifact to production. Instead, a root server layout reads the unprefixed
 * variables at request time and passes them here as props; React serializes
 * them into the RSC payload, so client components get real runtime values from
 * an environment-agnostic build.
 *
 * Values that identify the *build* rather than the environment
 * (`NEXT_PUBLIC_GIT_SHA`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_ID`, ...) are unaffected — they
 * are identical across a promote, so inlining them is correct.
 *
 * See platform/docs/deployment-architecture.md
