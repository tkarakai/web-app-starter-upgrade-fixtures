# still in the registry (tags are immutable and kept by the lifecycle policy),
# so nothing is rebuilt; an image that has aged out is rebuilt from the commit.
# Convex functions and landing are redeployed from the commit, exactly as
# cd-rollback.yml does. Schema changes are not undone: a rollback across a
# schema change needs the procedure in platform/docs/convex-migrations.md.
